# Dissertation_Ambient_Intelligence_System_Web
Web application that had been developed as part of a dissertation for MSc Advanced Computer Science at Sussex University in 2014. 

The web component has been developed to complement the AmI System that has been developed to quantitatively analyse data gathered from the AmI System.

There were a number of setbacks during the development of this project, which limited it's potential.

As of 2020 onwards, I am re-architecting and building this project on AWS.
